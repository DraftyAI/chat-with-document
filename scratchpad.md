**zoom and autofit toolbar prompt**

please change the alignment of the zoom and autofit toolbar for the document viewer to the bottom instead of the top. Do not change the actual buttons in any other way besides just putting it below the document

**chat input resizing prompt:**
great! Now let's resize the input  component to be 80% of the width and centered and double its height so that it can fit two rows of text**

**double-scrolling prompt:**

let's remove double scrolling from the columns. There should only be one scroll in each container, one for the document scroll and one for the chat history. Thefore that means the inner containers should both always fit within its parent container. Do not change the structure and hierarchu of the components in any way. Only the way height is calculated so the inner container/iframes always fit inside their parent container so there is no need for a vertical scroll in the parent conatiners

**my prompt:**

let's change the PDF and chat columns height to be dynamic based on viewport (or whatever is most appropriate) height instead of fixed at 600px but make sure they are always the same height as each other. There must also be enough room at the bottom of the window. DO NOT get rid of the inner chat container as that makes sure there is a scrollable section that never gets larger than a fixed percentage 95% of the total column height. There should always be a container inside the column

**response:**

I'll update the layout to use dynamic heights based on viewport height, making sure to leave room for the input. Let me first update the CSS to handle this:

Now let's update the app.py to use these dynamic heights:

I've made several changes to make the layout dynamic and responsive:

In the CSS:
Set column heights to calc(100vh - 140px) to take up viewport height minus space for input and margins
Made sure all containers and iframes respect their parent height
Created a fixed chat input container at the bottom with shadow and padding
Ensured all Streamlit containers properly fill their space
In app.py:
Removed fixed height containers since the column heights are now controlled by CSS
Added a fixed chat input container at the bottom
Simplified the container structure to let CSS handle the heights
The layout will now:

Take up the full viewport height minus 140px for both columns
Keep the chat input fixed at the bottom with a nice shadow
Scroll content within the columns when it overflows
Maintain equal heights for both columns automatically
Leave enough room at the bottom for the input and some padding
The 140px buffer accounts for:

Input height (~40px)
Input padding (2 * 16px = 32px)
Bottom margin (16px)
Top margin (16px)
Extra space for safety (36px)
This should give us a clean, responsive layout that works well at any viewport height while maintaining proper spacing.
